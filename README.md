## Music Bro
I aim to create a PWA that let's you upload your music collection and listen to it on multiple devices, while employing best practices.

## Goals (in no particular order)
1. Upload music files along with metadata that may help in creating system generated playlists.
2. See a paginated list of all songs, filter/sort them based on few metrics
3. Create/ Edit playlists.
4. Play music in a app like player, complete with all spotify like functions.
5. Select songs to download to avoid network requests.
6. Display space used and option to clear least played downloaded songs.
7. Visual themes selecting option ( not just dark and light ).
8. Even without explicit user intervention, app should be offline first.
9. Responsive design
10. Use modern React practices ( Hooks, TDD, Shareable components)
11. After completing functional app, focus on size and performance constraints.
12. Build the project in such a way that newbies can go through and learn about a opinionated approach to modern front end web dev.
